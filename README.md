- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Joachim-Otahal - Earning my income with PCs / Servers. In business since Novell 3.12 and Doom networking when that game was new.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computers since childhood, met Atari 2600 when it was new, and programmed first on C16 in Basic and Assembler. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning A LOT! Always, various areas, no ending. Stopping to learn is equal to death.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me here, but better on xing, linkedin, facebook etc etc etc... Just a simple google search away.
